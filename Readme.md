# WeatherBot
WeatherBot by Tom Janssen Groesbeek and Max Moons

## Idea

This blogpost describes our own implementation of a weather bot. It is a telegram based bot specialized in the weather domain. This means that you can send it a location or placename via the Telegram app and the bot will be able to respond with location related weather information. The development of the bot is partially based on part 1 and 2 of the following tutorial: https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/building-a-telegram-bot-using-python-part-1-goi5fncay. We also made use of the openweathermap.org/api to let the bot retrieve weather information.
