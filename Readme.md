# WeatherBot
WeatherBot by Tom Janssen Groesbeek (s4229738) and Max Moons (). Two students from the Radboud University Nijmegen.

## Idea

This blogpost describes our own implementation of a weather bot. It is a telegram based bot specialized in the weather domain. This means that you can send it a location or placename via the Telegram app and the bot will be able to respond with location related weather information. The development of the bot is partially based on part 1 and 2 of the following tutorial: [www.codementor.io](https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/building-a-telegram-bot-using-python-part-1-goi5fncay). We also made use of the [openweathermap.org](openweathermap.org/api) to let the bot retrieve weather information. 

## Telegram Tutorial

To get started on our bot we followed the tutorial by Gareth Dwyer on codementor. The original tutorial explains how to make a todo bot using the telegram api. The todo bot simply keeps track of the input provided by a telegram user. It echos the input and if an input is repeated it removes this input from the memory. So the bot can be used to keep a 'todo' list from which items are removed when repeated. 

Because we followed this tutorial, our bot was created by making use of the following:
* Python 3.5
* Telegram
* SQL

In order to get in contact with our telegram bot, simply add the following user to your telegram contacts:
